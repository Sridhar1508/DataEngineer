# Projects

My portfolio website features some of my web development projects. Here's a quick overview of what you can expect:

1.) Tuition Management System :-

The Tuition Management System is a web-based application designed to help tuition centers manage student records, fees payment details, attendance records, and registration forms. The system is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django Python framework, and MySQL database. Website Link :- [www.PhoenixTuitionCenter.com](https://sridhar2002.pythonanywhere.com/)

# Technologies Used

My portfolio website was created using pure HTML and CSS. I chose to use these technologies because I wanted to focus on creating a clean and responsive design without the use of frameworks or libraries.

# Design and Layout

I wanted my portfolio website to reflect my personal style and values. I chose a minimalist design with a focus on typography and white space. I also made sure that the website is accessible and easy to navigate.
